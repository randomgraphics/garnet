BUGS
====

- Startup of GFXOGL module sometimes very slow:
  - pin down to the 1st call to opengl function in oglWinDisp.cpp
  - It seems caused by remote symbol loading

- Render target image is up-side-down in OGL, comparing with D3D.
  - See GNsampleRenderToTexture for an example.

- GNsampleRenderToTexture:
  - black screen on cygwin.

- When using non-power-of-two texture, ATI x1000 card runs very very slow. Check it!

- Quad renderer is slow on HP notebook with intel graphics chip.

- ATI depth texture doesn't work when backbuffer size is smaller then texture 
  size (only happens when using debug DX runtime. So seems a DX bug)

TODO
====

- 程序中标注TODO的地方

- to make a simle game, like teris clone:
  - load effect/shader from xml file
  - load mesh
  - simple GUI
  - task manager/coordinator

- p1
  - memory pool class is not looking good
    - when call dtor and when not?
    - see others pool implementation on net
  - UT
    - VectorFile
    - Str::findFirst/LastOf(...)
  - try multi-thread architect
    - separate sim() and render() loop
    - File loader in another thread.
  - GFX system
    - render target management
      - D3D: msaa
      - OGL: FBO
    - queryXXX(....)
  - code page convertor
    - may support convertion from/to utf8 be enough?
  - sample application
    - GLSL test application
  - mesh class
  - blender exporter/importer
  - in-game GUI system
    - font class
  - refine sigslot class to allow any type of functor
  - string: use stack array for short string

- p2
  - GFX system
    - UT of LRU list in resource manager
    - consider remove drawBegin() and drawEnd()
    - renderer state dump system
    - UT to make sure OGL resource creation/deletion do not affect renderer states
    - add support to OGL FSAA
    - Cg shader
    - consider removing syscopy from vertex/index buffer
      - remove sys-copy of VBO.
    - Why D3D quad renderer is so slow, comparing with CEGUI sample application.
    - support render-to-texture on xenon (including depth texture)
    - UT: format conversion between ClrFmt and D3DFMT
    - test: IDirect3DDevice9::UpdateTexture() when target is render target texture.
    - learn EXT_framebuffer_object, ARB_draw_buffer, ARB_pixel_buffer_object
    - shared uniform
  - more sofisitcated log management: see log4cxx for example.
    - runtime switchable GN_TRACE( level, msg, .... )

- p3
  - new build system:
    - two steps:
      - compiler configuration script, called by setupEnv.cmd/setupEnv.sh
      - build script
  - support to multiple joysticks.
  - image format conversion
  - try implementing a ray tracer
  - check doxygen errors and warnings.
  - Custom sscanf(...)
  - cross-platform window util functions:
    - set window title
    - change window size
    - ...
  - runtime call-stack dump
  - hash map/table
  - implement POSIX version of GN::path:glob()
  - UT for path functions: resolve, glob

ISSUES
======

- Custom string class or std::string?
  - RESOLVED: custom string class.
  - WHY?
    - std::string can't accept NULL pointer as valid input.
    - std::char_trait<wchar_t> is not well supported on cygwin.

- TinyXml or Expat w/ DOM wrapper?
  - OPEN.
    - TinyXml:
      - easy to use (DOM)
      - no format output to string buffer
    - Expat
      - may faster then TinyXml
      - need a wrapper to make it easy to use
      - no xml output support
