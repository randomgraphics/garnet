BUGS
====

- GFX:
  - GetDeviceCaps(...) in basicDispMgr.cpp always returns information of the
    monitor where the render window was orginally created in.
  - Startup of GFXOGL module sometimes very slow:
    - pin down to the 1st DescribePixelFormat() in sChoosePixelFormat() in oglWinDisp.cpp
    - It seems caused by remote symbol loading

TODO
====

- Code coverage of UT of GFX module.
- continue implementing GFX module
- create a custom meta-thread management system
- XWindow class
- cross-platform window util functions:
  - set window title
  - change window size
  - ...
- GN_TRACE( level, msg, .... )
- runtime call-stack dump
- hash map/table
- implement POSIX version of GN::path:glob()
- UT for path functions: resolve, glob
- implement GNogl on POSIX platform

DONE
====
- convert input module to static library
- Fix link problem of GFX module in static build.
- Refine GFX:
  - Window property save/restore
  - Refine ntWindow class:
    - support external window
    - getClientSize();
  - remove platform specific code from display manager.
  - UT for GFX module: using external render window
- Run UT for both GFXD3D and GFXOGL will throw exception.
  - FIXED: should use different render window class for each instance of NTRenderWindow.
