BUGS
====

- GFX:
  - GetDeviceCaps(...) in basicDispMgr.cpp always returns information of the
    monitor where the render window was orginally created in.
  - Startup of GFXOGL module sometimes very slow:
    - pin down to the 1st DescribePixelFormat() in sChoosePixelFormat() in oglWinDisp.cpp
    - It seems caused by remote symbol loading

ISSUES
======

- Use boost jam, or refine SCons?
  - bjam
    - pros
      - fast script parsing speed
      - build-in support to amd64
    - cons
      - can't generate VC project
  - SCons
    - pros
      - can generate VC project
      - much more readable then jam code.
    - cons
      - script parsing is a little bit slow
      - no amd64 support
      - can distinguish different version of same compiler

TODO
====

- p1
  - Code coverage of UT of BASE and GFX module.
  - UT for getEnv() and setEnv().
  - continue implementing GFX module
  - XWindow class UT
  - implement GNogl on POSIX platform
- p2
  - Rewrite SCons script
  - Custom sscanf(...)
  - cross-platform window util functions:
    - set window title
    - change window size
    - ...
  - GN_TRACE( level, msg, .... )
  - runtime call-stack dump
  - hash map/table
  - implement POSIX version of GN::path:glob()
  - UT for path functions: resolve, glob

DONE
====
- convert input module to static library
- Fix link problem of GFX module in static build.
- Refine GFX:
  - Window property save/restore
  - Refine ntWindow class:
    - support external window
    - getClientSize();
  - remove platform specific code from display manager.
  - UT for GFX module: using external render window
- Run UT for both GFXD3D and GFXOGL will throw exception.
  - FIXED: should use different render window class for each instance of NTRenderWindow.
