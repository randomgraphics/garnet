TODO
====

- 程序中标注TODO的地方

- p0
  - scene framework refactor:
    - separate spatial and rendering management
    - experiment with scene framework that supports ultra large world
      - spatial management
      - resource streaming
  - a coordinate basis renderer (like Maya)
  - skin mesh test case: porting DXSDK sample.

- p1
  - renderer unit test framework
  - Enable ETW in profiler
  - D3D11 renderer
  - GPU resouce aliasing

- p2
  - mesh classes
    - refine GPU mesh concept:
      - could mesh reference effect directly?
      - could mesh be a direct parameter of GPU, like texture?
        - No. See resolved issues for details.
    - a cpu mesh that could be used to convert mesh format
    - a half-edge mesh for more complex mesh algorithm
  - PCXS2 GPU plugin:
    - move operations to GPU as much as possible
    - model beautifier
      - add bump map and tessellation to PS2 model if possible.
      - implement a CPU based prototype first.
  - effect and mesh loader/exporter (from/to XML)
  - FBX loader
  - 3DS loader
  - DDS viewer plugin
  	- don't write full viewer from scratch.
  	- just provide a plugin for existing picture viewers like acdsee or something.
  - sigslot class:
    - allow any type of functor
    - check behavior of redundant slot functors.
  - memory-mapped IO.

- p3
  - XML: pointer from parent to last child, for constant time child appending.
  - Custom sscanf(...)
  - cross-platform window util functions:
    - set window title
    - change window size
    - ...
    - use wxWidgets?
  - runtime call-stack dump
  - in game GUI:
  - debug variable registry
    - debug variable viewer and modifier
  - COLLADA loader
  - make sure OGL resource creation/deletion do not affect renderer states
    - depends on renderer state dumper

- more
  - refine build system
    - figure out a way to simplify scons script
  - image format conversion
  - a ray tracer (for self-learning purpose)

ISSUES
======

- Could mesh be a first class parameter of GPU, like texture?
  - RESOLVED: No, since that would make resource aliasing impossible.

- Unified interface for different APIs is too difficult, and maybe pointless.
  How about a higher level abstraction: material/effect system?
  - RESOLVED: we need both
    - They stay at different level ans serve for different purpose.
      - Unified API is easy for prototyping
      - Material/effect system is required to build complex rendering framework.
        It could be built upon unified API, or not.

- Do we need embed buffer for short string?

- Custom string class or std::string?
  - RESOLVED: custom string class.
  - WHY?
    - std::string can't accept NULL pointer as valid input.
    - std::char_trait<wchar_t> is not well supported on cygwin.

- TinyXml or Expat w/ DOM wrapper?
  - RESOLVED: expat.
    - expat is faster.
    - custom DOM wrapper fits our requirement better, and is pretty easy to implement.

DROPPED TASKS
=============
- runtime configuable profilers, like loggers
  - WHY: profiler has to be light-weight and fast. Logger style configuration
         is too heavy.
